        <br><h2>Administrative Details</h2>
        <p>
            NTNUI Bordtennis
        </p>


        <br><h2>Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
        <p>
            ** THIS IS JUST LIKE P1 ** The purpose of this website is to be both a connection for table tennis interested students, and the organization, as well as to be an information hub for the organization. Therefore, our primary goal is to provide users with the opportunity to join open training/tryouts, and join the organization, so that the organization can get new active members. therefore, we will provide contact information, and the training schedule in a neat manner.
        </p>


        <br><h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
        <p>
            Content hierarchy wise should be similar to NTNUI's website with 5 different pages to our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the navigation bar one will be able to ...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Home page
            </li>
            <li>
                Intro to table tennis
            </li>
            <li>
                Regular training
            </li>
            <li>
                Social gatherings
            </li>
            <li>
                Contact
            </li>

        </ul>


        <br><h2>Page Layout and Appearence</h2>


        <br><h2>Content</h2>
        <p>
            There will be five seperate pages as follows:
        </p>
        
        <h3> 1. index.html (homepage) </h3>
        <p>
            Because our client is apart of the larger organization Ntnui our homepage will not be too different from theirs. The homepage will be the landing page for those who visit our website, and to intrigue the user and make them browse our website it will not include a lot of text to overwhelm the user. A navigation bar to the other sites will sit on top of the homepage. An image that will be randomly selected through the use of javascript will sit in the middle of the page. By scrolling down the page, the user will be met by a call-to-action button to regular training, newest events (matches, social gatherings) and member scoreboard in that order. Lastly we will include an easy to spot button on the bottom of the page that takes the user to the contact page.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Intro.html (Intro to table tennis)</h3>
        <p>
            This section will focus on giving an introduction to table tennis for new players as well as information regarding tryouts and how to become a member.This page achieves the goal of teaching new players general rules, giving a better understanding of the table tennis rules as well as giving the user easy access to tryouts and member application. The page is educational and will contain a bunch of text, multiple infoboxes and links to the NTNUI Bordtennis Facebook site.
