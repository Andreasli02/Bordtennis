    <br><h2>Testing Document</h2>
    <p>
        We decided to use live testing of our website to get insight of how users would interact with the site.
        We did not create any a google form to send out as we decided live testing was a better way of gaining 
        insight. The testers use their own devices for testing such that we would get a varied number of testing 
        platforms inclouding mobile. We used a couple general questions for our users while doing live testing 
        if they did not know what to look for. These questions are listed below:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Are you intersted in table tennis?</li>
        <li>How is the usability of the website?</li> 
        <li>Is it easy to navigate on the page?</li>
        <li>Does the content match the subject of the website?</li>
        <li>Is it easy to find and acess contact information?</li>
        <li>Are there any functions you miss?</li>
        <li>How does the excisting functions work?</li>
        <li>How would you rate the professionalism of the site?</li>
        <li>Is it a clear cut usage to the page?</li>
        <li>How is the structure and design of the webiste?</li>
        <li>What catches your eyes first?</li>
        <li>Do the color palates fit the page?</li>
        <li>Is there a clear call to action on every page?</li>
        <li>Does the website work well on your platform?</li>
        <li>Final thoughts?</li>
    </ol>

    <br><h2>Testing Audience</h2>

    <p>We conducted live testing at NTNU, with contestants studying informatics and computer enginering. 
        We focused on getting feedback from experienced programmers, student assistants and masters students. 
        This worked out great and we got insight from well versed programmers. It consistet of 100% college students. 
        Of those students were 14% student assistants and 14% master students. We also asked if the students where
        intersested in table tennis and therfore in the intended audience. Of the students 42% where interested in table tennis.
    </p>

    <br><h2>Testing Platforms</h2>

        <li>Lenovo Thinkpad in Microsoft edge + different dimensions</li>
    </ul>

    <br><h2>Feedback Summary</h2>

    <p>
       We got a bunch of feedback from the live testing we conducted, both criticism and praise. The general consensus was very positive.
       The page worked well on all platforms and dimensions. WIDE SCRENNN??. The usability of the site is great, but there were complaints 
       about the visabilty of the navbar at the top of the page. Due to the black color of these icons some users where not able to see and 
       therfore not bale to use this navbar. This was only visable in non darkmode. The testers enjoyed the current functions, espesiclly darkmode
       and had no need for any new ones. The color scheme of black and red representing the table tennis colors where apriciated and the validation
       on the contact page worked well. However the page does not react in any big way to users giving an input and serving that input. Testers wished
       for some sort of user feedback when sending in the membership form. The calandar got a lot of praise and the website had a lot of usefull content.
       Lastly some users also complained that the email links in the footer of the page where not set to <code>target = "_blank"</code> and that there 
       home page could lead dircetly to the content, skipping the image gallery and the NTNUI Table Tennis logo, making the page even more usable.

    <br><h2>Your Response</h2>
        <p>
            The feedback we got was mostly positvite so there was not a great amount of change needed. We did respond to the feedback we got However
            and thought about differnet ways we could implement imporvemnts to the site based on the insight we got from live testing. The important 
            changes we found where changing the color scheme of the navbar at the top of the page making it more visable and therfore more usable. 
            We implemented a white background to the navbar icons making them more visable to the users. The second porblem that came up was the 
            user feedback from the membership form. A resolve would be adding a pop up or alert that come up after sending in the form or adding 
            the text written in the form to an email, making it easy to go over the text and send. We decided to implement a pop up alert?
            We fixed the usability issue of the mail links on the bottom of the page by making them target blank. The final suggestion we looked in to
            was the idea of the page leading directly to content skipping the image gallary and the logo. We concluded that this was a needed part 
            of the wep page as this shows the user what the page is about in the logo, but we took the feedback to heart and made it so the image gallary
            never filled the home page and some information always was in veiw. We could have created a cookies for directing the page directly to the content, 
            but we deemed giving the user a clear cut depiction of the subject of the page trough the logo as more important.
