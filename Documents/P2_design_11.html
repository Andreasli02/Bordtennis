        <br><h2>Administrative Details</h2>
        <p>
            NTNUI Bordtennis
        </p>


        <br><h2>Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
        <p>
            <b> THIS IS JUST LIKE P1 </b> The purpose of this website is to be both a connection for table tennis interested students, and the organization, as well as to be an information hub for the organization. Therefore, our primary goal is to provide users with the opportunity to join open training/tryouts, and join the organization, so that the organization can get new active members. therefore, we will provide contact information, and the training schedule in a neat manner.
        </p>


        <br><h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
        <p>
            Content hierarchy wise should be similar to NTNUI's website with 5 different pages to our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the navigation bar one will be able to access all the other pages in the website. To ensure less confusion on this for the website's users we will
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Home page
            </li>
            <li>
                Intro to table tennis
            </li>
            <li>
                Regular training
            </li>
            <li>
                Social gatherings

            </li>

        </ul>


        <br><h2>Page Layout and Appearence</h2>
        <p>
            When we started the brainstorming on the design of the website,
            first of all, we agreed we wanted to take inspiration from <a href="https://ntnui.no/">NTNUI</a> to design our site.
            Then any user who have looked around at NTNUI's site will in some way follow the same "flow" and "feel at home".
            Also, we wanted it to look clean with enough "whitespace", not an overwhelming amount of information and easy on the eyes.
            Therefore we also wanted to add a "dark mode" for users who want that.
            For the color palette, we wanted a theme following white, black and red - the same ones used for tabletennis accessories.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="mockups/colorScheme.png" alt="colorScheme" width="100%">
            <figcaption>Color palette we use as reference</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            As of the navigation, we have chosen a "hamburger menu". It looks simple, feels futuristic and is easy to use.
            It's also within the non-functional requirements that users shall be able to access information about upcoming matches in less than two clicks.
            The logo for NTNUI Bordtennis will always be on the top left, and bring the user back to the index-page if clicked on.
            Also, every page will be listed in the footer, amongst other useful information we will retrieve from the client further in development of the site. 
        </p>

            <figcaption>The base design we will use across the website. The content will change based on the page</figcaption>

        <br><h2>Content</h2>
        <p><b>*** ADD INFO ABOUT THE FONT SOMEWHERE***</b></p>
        <p>
            There will be five seperate pages as follows:
        </p>
        
        <h3> 1. index.html (homepage) </h3>
        <p>
            Because our client is apart of the larger organization - Ntnui - our homepage will not be too different from theirs. The homepage will be the landing page for those who visit our website. So to intrigue the user and make them browse our website it will follow our base design and not include a lot of text. At the top of the page the user will be greeted with a series of big pictures, which will change in intervals we will choose at a later time (This is something we have to take our time with, to make sure it does not feel to rapid and "stressed").  We will use Javascript to make this work as we want. By scrolling down the page, the user will be met by a call-to-action button to regular training, newest events (matches, social gatherings) and member scoreboard in that order. Lastly we will include an easy to spot button on the bottom of the page that takes the user to the contact page.
        </p>
        <img src="mockups/index-mockup.png" alt="index-mockup" width="400">

        <h3>2. Intro.html (Intro to table tennis)</h3>
        <p>
            This section will focus on giving an introduction to table tennis for new players as well as information regarding tryouts and how to become a member. This page achieves the goal of giving new players tips adn tricks, providing a better understanding of the table tennis rules as well as giving the user easy access to tryouts and member application. The page is meant to educat the users and there will therfore be a lot of text. It will contain a list of tips and tricks, equipment and rulsets in different infoboxes. At the bottom of the page the user will find links to member application and tryouts on the NTNUI Bordtennis facebook site. 
        </p>

        <h3>3. training.html (Regular training)</h3>
        <p>This page  will contain any information about upcoming gatherings, trainings, tournaments and events, in a structured way. The goal og this site will be to provide the user with information about future events in the NTNUI table tennis calander. In standard view, the visitor will get a caldendar view of the current month. It will be possible to maneuver between different months to see all planned events.</p>

        <h3>4. Social.html (Social gatherings)</h3>
        <p>
            In the “social gatherings” site we will include pictures of Previous events/tournaments and excursions, each with their own subsection and caption describing what the events and excursions was all about. The purpose and goal of this site is to show that the organization is a very good social platform to meet new people with a common interest, and that the importance of winning does not overpower the fun aspect of the sport. We will make sure that the design of the website is as simple and user friendly as possible since it will primarily be used as a gallery.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Contact.html (Contact us)</h3>
        <p>This site will include the contact information of the coach and group leader and will act as a portal for asking and answering questions that are not answered on the website. There will be a link to the groups facebook page and the sub-page within NTNUI for more information. We will also include an easy-to-access form users can fill out to become a new member of the team. 
        </p>

        <br><h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            The minimum requirements are to make at least four JS scripts.
            We plan on making six:
        </p>
        <h3>1. scoreboard.js (Scoreboard)</h3>
        <p>
            A script to dynamically display information to a scoreboard.
            It will sort the list of players with their scores from highest to lowest score.
        </p>
        <h3>2. training_table.js (Training table)</h3> 
        <p>
            A script to dynamically display events and training times.
            It will be displayed in a weekly calendar, where the user will be able 
            to scroll through the weeks.
        </p>
        <h3>3. form_validation.js (Form validation)</h3>
        <p>
            A script for checking whether or not the filled in sign up form is valid.
        </p>
        <h3>4. hamburger_navbar.js (Hamburger navbar)</h3>
        <p>
            A script for a button that reveals links to the different pages on the site.
            This button will be in the top right in the navbar.
        </p>
        <h3>5. homepage_gallery.js (Homepage gallery)</h3>
        <p>
            In the homepage the user will be met with an image. This image should switch to the next
            image in the gallery after a certain amount of time.
        </p>
        <h3>6. dark_mode.js (Dark mode/Light mode toggle)</h3>
        <p>
            There will be a button to toggle between dark and light mode. 
        </p>
