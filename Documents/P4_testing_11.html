    <br><h2>Testing Document</h2>
    <p>
        We decided to use live testing of our website to get insight of how users would interact with the site.
        We did not create any a google form to send out as we decided live testing was a better way of gaining 
        insight. The testers use their own devices for testing such that we would get a varied number of testing 
        platforms inclouding mobile. We used a couple general questions for our users while doing live testing 
        if they did not know what to look for. These questions are listed below:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Are you intersted in table tennis?</li>
        <li>How is the usability of the website?</li> 
        <li>Is it easy to navigate on the page?</li>
        <li>Does the content match the subject of the website?</li>
        <li>Is it easy to find and acess contact information?</li>
        <li>Are there any functions you miss?</li>
        <li>How does the excisting functions work?</li>
        <li>How would you rate the professionalism of the site?</li>
        <li>Is it a clear cut usage to the page?</li>
        <li>How is the structure and design of the webiste?</li>
        <li>What catches your eyes first?</li>
        <li>Do the color palates fit the page?</li>
        <li>Is there a clear call to action on every page?</li>
        <li>Does the website work well on your platform?</li>
        <li>Final thoughts?</li>
    </ol>

    <br><h2>Testing Audience</h2>

    <p>We conducted live testing at NTNU, with contestants studying informatics and computer enginering. 
        We focused on getting feedback from experienced programmers, student assistants and masters students. 
        This worked out great and we got insight from well versed programmers. It consistet of 100% college students. 
        Of those students were x% student assistants and x% master students. We also asked if the students where
        intersested in table tennis and therfore in the intended audience. Of the students x% where interested in table tennis.
