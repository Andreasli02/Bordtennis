    <p>
        We decided to use live testing of our website to get insight of how users would interact with the site.
        We did not create any a google form to send out as we decided live testing was a better way of gaining insight.
        The testers use their own devices for testing such that we would get a varied number of testing platforms.
        We used a couple general questions for our users while doing live testing if they did not know what to look for. These questions are listed below:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>How is the usability of the website?</li> 
        <li>Is it easy to find and acess contact information?</li>
        <li>Are there any functions you miss?</li>
        <li>How does teh excisting functions work?</li>
        <li>How would you rate the professionalism of the site</li>
        <li>Is it a clear cut usage to the page?</li>
        <li>How is the structure and design of the webiste?</li>
        <li>What catches your eyes first?</li>
        <li>Do the color palates fit the page?</li>
        <li>Is there a clear call to action on every page?</li>A
    </ol>

    <br><h2>Testing Audience</h2>
    <!--A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the
website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of your 
tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% of college students, 46% school 
administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can do the same. If you were able 
to do live testing with a few users, describe that as well.-->

    <br><h2>Testing Platforms</h2>
    <!--A summary of the different platforms (devices and browsers) that your testers used.-->

    <br><h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
    <!--A summary of the feedback you received organized by question type (design, navigation, content, 
        usability, etc.). Highlight both positive comments and thoughtful criticism, your client's testimonial, etc.-->
    
    <br><h2>Your Response</h2>
    <!--Provide your response to the feedback. Concretely, describe what you could do (once the class is over) to address 
        this feedback with changes in your design or implementation. You can also address why some of the raised issues or 
        suggestions for improvements are difficult or impossible to tackle.-->

    <br><h2>Self-reflection</h2>
    <!--Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you learned from it. Are there general lessons that
         you learned, beyond the nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this seriously and be 
         thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to hear.
