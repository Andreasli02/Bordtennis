    <p>
        We decided to use live testing of our website to get insight of how users would interact with the site.
        We did not create any a google form to send out as we decided live testing was a better way of gaining
        insight. The testers use their own devices for testing such that we would get a varied number of testing
        platforms inclouding mobile. We used a couple general questions for our users while doing live testing
        if they did not know what to look for. These questions are listed below:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Are you intersted in table tennis?</li>
        <li>How is the usability of the website?</li>
        <li>Is it easy to navigate on the page?</li>
        <li>Does the content match the subject of the website?</li>
        <li>Is it easy to find and acess contact information?</li>
        <li>Are there any functions you miss?</li>
        <li>How does the excisting functions work?</li>
        <li>How would you rate the professionalism of the site?</li>
        <li>Is it a clear cut usage to the page?</li>
        <li>How is the structure and design of the webiste?</li>
        <li>What catches your eyes first?</li>
        <li>Do the color palates fit the page?</li>
        <li>Is there a clear call to action on every page?</li>
        <li>Does the website work well on your platform?</li>
        <li>Final thoughts?</li>
    </ol>

    <br><h2>Testing Audience</h2>

    <p>We conducted live testing at NTNU, with contestants studying informatics and computer enginering.
        We focused on getting feedback from experienced programmers, student assistants and masters students.
        This worked out great and we got insight from well versed programmers. It consistet of 100% college students.
        Of those students were 14% student assistants and 14% master students. We also asked if the students where
        intersested in table tennis and therfore in the intended audience. Of the students 42% where interested in table tennis.
    </p>

    <br><h2>Testing Platforms</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>M1 mac air 2020 in safari</li>
        <li>M1 mac air 2020 in Google Chrome</li>
        <li>Intel Macbook pro 2019 in Google Chrome</li>
        <li>One plus 9 in Googe Chrome</li>

        <li>Lenova yoga slim 7 in Google chrome</li>
        <li>Lenovo Thinkpad in Microsoft edge + different dimensions</li>
    </ul>

    <br><h2>Feedback Summary</h2>

    <p>
       We got a bunch of feedback from the live testing we conducted, both criticism and praise. The general consensus was very positive.
       The page worked well on all platforms and dimensions. WIDE SCRENNN??. The usability of the site is great, but there were complaints
       about the visabilty of the navbar at the top of the page. Due to the black color of these icons some users where not able to see and
       therfore not bale to use this navbar. This was only visable in non darkmode. The testers enjoyed the current functions, espesiclly darkmode
       and had no need for any new ones. The color scheme of black and red representing the table tennis colors where apriciated and the validation
       on the contact page worked well. However the page does not react in any big way to users giving an input and serving that input. Testers wished
       for some sort of user feedback when sending in the membership form. The calandar got a lot of praise and the website had a lot of usefull content.
       Lastly some users also complained that the email links in the footer of the page where not set to <code>target blank</code>

    <br><h2>Self-reflection</h2>
    <!--Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you learned from it. Are there general lessons that
         you learned, beyond the nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this seriously and be
         thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to hear.
